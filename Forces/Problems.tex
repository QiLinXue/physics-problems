\question

Mr. Stewart has broken into a bank and stole a block of silver and a block of gold. He attaches the two blocks together with a 2m long string and begins pulling the silver block with a force $F$ to make it start moving. Notice that the coefficients of friction are different for each block.

\begin{parts}
    \part
    Draw a free body diagram for each block.

    \part
    What is the minimum force $F$ required?

    \part
    After the blocks start moving. What is the acceleration?

    \part
    What is the tension in the rope between the two blocks?

    \part
    Suddenly after 15 seconds, the police come and Mr. Stewart stops dead in his tracks. Although the silver block stops with him, the gold block continues forward. Using Newton's Laws, explain why this occurs.
    
    \part
    Will the gold block collide with the silver block? If so, what will its speed be when it collides?

    \part
    The bored 60kg police officer asks Mr. Stewart to drag the blocks back to the bank. However, he decides to sits on the gold block. Mr. Stewart agrees and starts dragging the blocks back. Draw a free body diagram for when the system is moving. There is enough friction between the officer and the gold block such that he does not slide off.

    \part
    When Mr. Stewart is moving at 1m/s, the police officer tells him to move at a constant velocity. What force does Mr. Stewart need to pull with to maintain a constant velocity of 1m/s?

    \part
    However, Mr. Stewart is a rebel. He decides to increase his velocity just enough so the police officer starts sliding off. If the coefficient of static friction between him and the gold block is $\mu_s=0.5$, how much does he need to increase the force he's currently applying?
\end{parts}

\question
Mr. Stewart is taken into custody. However, when no one was looking he ran into a small closet. He thought he was safe, but when he heard approaching footsteps he was forced to hide. Using his superhuman strength, he hid at the top of the closet wedged between two opposing walls. His hands and feet exert a force of $80N$ each on the walls, which is just enough to keep him still.

        \draw (2,2.8) rectangle (3,2.55);

    \end{tikzpicture}

\begin{parts}
    \part
    Draw a free body diagram for his entire body.
    \part
    What is the coefficient of static friction between the room and Mr. Stewart?
    \part
    Suddenly, a police officer walks in. Luckily, he does not see Mr. Stewart hiding. However, the room starts accelerates at $1m/s^2$ vertically. Mr. Stewart finds that he needs to exert more force to stay stationary relative to the elevator. Is the elevator moving up or down?
    \part
    What is the minimum force his hands and feet need to exert now?
\end{parts}

\question
After the officer leaves and escaping the elevator, Mr. Stewart finds himself on the roof of the police station. He spots a heavy block attached to a pulley with a long rope. Mr. Stewart decides to grab the end of the rope and descend, using the block to slow his descent. The building is 20 meters high and Mr. Stewart can survive the fall if he contacts the ground at $15 m/s$. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the roof is $0.8$.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw (0,0) rectangle (5,8);
        \draw (1,8) rectangle (2,9) node[pos=0.5] {$m=?$};
        \filldraw[fill=white, draw=black] (5,8) circle (0.5);

        \draw (2,8.5) -- (5,8.5);
        \draw (5.5,8) -- (5.5,4);

        \node at (1.5,7.5) {$\mu_{k}=0.8$};
        \node at (4,4) {$h=20m$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{parts}
    \part
    What is the minimum weight needed for the block in order for Mr. Stewart to live?
    \part
    5 meters down the building, the 60kg police officer from earlier comes and stands on the ramp. What is Mr. Stewart's acceleration?
    \part
    To try to slow down Mr. Stewart's descent even more, the police officer while still on the block, pushes down on the block with his hands with a force of $10N$. How much has Mr. Stewart's acceleration changed from part (b)?
    \part
    Will Mr. Stewart still be able to make it down safely? (Remember, Mr. Stewart can let go of the rope any time and live so long as the impact speed is less than $15 m/s$)
    \part
    Caught up in the heat of the motion, Mr. Stewart attempts to speed up his descent by pulling downwards on the rope he's attached to. Will this help? Use Newton's Laws to explain.
