Kinematics is the study of the motion of objects.
\\\\
In this chapter, we will be using the constants $x, v, a$ to represent position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively.  Unless otherwise stated, subscripts "$0 \; and \; f$" will be given to represent the original and final value of the variable. (e.g. $v_0$ is the starting velocity and $v_f$ is the final velocity)
\\\\
It is important to know that the problems we will be dealing with have \emph{uniform accelerated motion}, meaning the acceleration does not change.
