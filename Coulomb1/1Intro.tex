You are beginning your studies of electrostatics, the study of stationary charges. This chapter will only focus on coulomb's law and the applications on single particles. If you think this is hard, you'll love the next chapters :)

There are many similarities between electrostatics and gravitation. In this chapter, we will be focusing more on Coulomb's law and hopefully point out many parallels between two seemingly unrelated fields (pun intended)
