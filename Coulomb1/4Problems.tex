\begin{question}
What are the units for permittivity of free space $\epsilon_0$?

\end{question}

\begin{solution}

Rearrange the equation to solve for $\epsilon_0$, and give all variables a value of 1 in order to figure out the units for $\epsilon_0$. Please note, that we are giving everything a value of 1 for the sole purpose of making adding, multiplying, and dividing units much easier. It of course is not necessary, but helps to build an intuition of dimensional analysis.

The final value of course, is going to be incorrect, but we only care about the units. Because of this, we can ignore $2\pi$ since it is dimensionless.

\begin{equation*}
F = \frac{Q_1Q_2}{\epsilon_0R^2} \rightarrow
\epsilon_0 = \frac{Q_1Q_2}{FR^2} \rightarrow
\epsilon_0 = \frac{(1C)(1C)}{(1N)(1m)^2} \rightarrow
\epsilon_0 = (1C^2)(1N^{-1})(1m^{-2})
\end{equation*}

Thus $\epsilon_0$ has SI units of $C^2N^{-1}m^{-2}$
\end{solution}

\begin{question}
Two $1\mu C$ charges lie at (1,0) and at (0,1).
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Calculate the magnitude of the force that $1-\mu C$ charge at (0,1) exerts on the $1\mu C$ charge at (1,0)
    \item Calculate the components of this force in the x- and y-directions and express the force as a vector.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}

The first thing we do is draw a diagram: see the figure below. We are attempting to calculate the force, and since the charges of both particles are already given to us, we need to figure out the distance separating them which can be done using geometry.

\begin{center}
% \begin{tikzpicture}
% \begin{axis}[
%     axis lines=middle,
%     xmin=0, xmax=2,
%     ymin=0, ymax=2,
%     xtick=1, ytick=1,
%     xlabel = $x$,
%     ylabel = $y$,
% ]
% \addplot [only marks] table {
% 1   0
% 0   1
% };

% \addplot [domain=-10:10, samples=2, dashed] {1-x};
% \end{axis}
% \end{tikzpicture}
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{Figures/Figure26}
\end{center}
(A) Thus the force is, using (2.1):
\begin{equation*}
    F=\frac{Q_1Q_2}{2\pi\epsilon_0R^2}=
    \frac{(1 \times 10^{-6}C)^2}
    {(2\pi)(8.854 \times 10^{-12}C^2N^{-1}m^{-2})(\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}^2)}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    F = 4.5 \times 10^{-3} N
\end{equation*}

(B) To calculate the components, we break up the \emph{magnitude} of the force we calculated in part A into components using standard geometry. Note that the y component is negative, because the charge at (1,0) will be wanting to move in the negative y and positive x direction.
\begin{equation*}
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            F_x = (4.5 \times 10^{-3} N)cos(45^\circ) = 3.18 \times 10^{-3} N
            \\
            F_y = -(4.5 \times 10^{-3} N)cos(45^\circ) = -3.18 \times 10^{-3} N
        \end{array}
              \right.
\end{equation*}

Combining everything together gives the force vector:

\begin{equation*}
    \vec{F} = (3.18 \times 10^{-3} N)\hat{i} - 
              (3.18 \times 10^{-3} N)\hat{j}    
\end{equation*}

\end{solution}

\begin{question}
A point charge +Q is located at the origin and a point charge -2Q is located at (1,0). Where is the electric field equal to zero? (Everything is in SI units)

\end{question}

\begin{solution}
The first thing to realize is that the only place the electric field can ever be zero is along the x-axis.\footnote{think about suspending an object under two magnets. It only works if it's directly underneath both of them!} Before we brute force, let's make a diagram and think about the question qualitatively.

% \begin{center}
%   \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
%     \draw (-3,0) -- (3,0);
%     \foreach \i in {-3,-2,...,3} % numbers on line
%       \draw (\i,0.1) -- + (0,-0.2) node[below] {$\i$};
%     \fill[blue] (0,0) circle (0.5 mm);
%     \fill[red]  (1,0) circle (1 mm);
%   \end{tikzpicture}   
% \end{center}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{Figures/Figure27}
\end{center}
Where on the x-axis should we look for solutions? We have three options:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Between (0,0) and (1,0): both charges produce an electric field in the +x direction.
    \item Between (1,0) and $\infty$: In this region, the -2Q charge is always dominant, also providing a nonzero electric field.
    \item Between (0,0) and -$\infty$: In this region, when we are very close to the +Q charge, the +Q charge will dominate. However, as we move further and further away, the effects of distance will be less and less prominent and the -2Q charge will come to dominate. We will call this location (x,0)
\end{enumerate}
 
To do the math, we simply need to use superposition:

\begin{equation}
    E_{net} = E_{+Q} + E_{-2Q} \rightarrow
    0 = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2} + 
        \frac{-2Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0(1-x)^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2} = 
    \frac{2Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0(1-x)^2} \rightarrow
    \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{2}{(1-x)^2} \rightarrow
    2x^2 = (x+1)^2
\end{equation}

Solving this quadratic relation gives $x=-1\pm\sqrt{2}$. Since we already established that x is negative, we know the electric field is zero at $x=-1-\sqrt{2}$

\end{solution}

\begin{question}
A point charge $Q_1$ is located at the origin and a point charge $Q_2$ is located at (5,0). Which of the following situations have a point or points where the potential is zero? (more than one may apply)

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
 \hline
       & $Q_1$ & $Q_2$ \\ 
 I      & +q  & +3q  \\ 
 II     & -q  & +17q \\ 
 III    & -3q & -q   \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{question}


\begin{solution}
Using the superposition formula for potential, we see that it is only possible for potential to be zero, when the charges have opposite signs:

\begin{equation*}
    V_{net}=0=\frac{Q_1}{x^2}+\frac{Q_2}{(5-x)^2}
\end{equation*}

Therefore, II is the correct answer.

Another solution is to draw the graphs of V(x) for each individual charge, and then superposition them like in the following figure:

\begin{center}
% \begin{tikzpicture}
% \begin{axis}[
%     axis lines=middle,
%     xmin=-20, xmax=20,
%     ymin=-20, ymax=20,
%     xlabel = $x$,
%     ylabel = $V$,
% ]
% %Below the red is defined
% \addplot [
%     domain=-20:20, 
%     samples=100, 
%     color=red,
%     style={ultra thick}
% ]
% {-1/(x^2)};
% \addlegendentry{$V_{-q}$}

% %Here the blue is defined
% \addplot [
%     domain=-20:20, 
%     samples=100, 
%     color=blue,
%     style={ultra thick},
% ]
% {17*x/((6-x)^2)};
% \addlegendentry{$V_{17q}$}

% \end{axis}
% \end{tikzpicture}
\includegraphics{Figures/Figure28}
\end{center}

All we need to prove is that if we add these two functions, it will have at least one real root. This proof will be left as an exercise to the reader.\footnote{Hint: You can prove this in two ways. Either use the mean value theorem, or notice that the peaks and troughs are located at different locations...}

\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{question}
Which of the three charge distributions introduced in the previous exercise has point(s) where the electric field is zero?
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
We have already proved in an earlier exercise that in, the electric field between two opposite charges different in magnitude, there is one point where it is zero. In a charge distribution where both charges have equal signs, there is also one place where the electric field is zero, this time in between both charges. This is the spot where the charges cancel out.

The answer is I,II and III
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{question}
Points $Q_1$, $Q_2$, $Q_3$, and $Q_4$ are located at (-1,1),(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,-1) respectively. Which of the following charge distributions is the electric field zero at the origin?

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c| } 
 \hline
       & $Q_1$ & $Q_2$ & $Q_3$ & $Q_4$ \\ 
 I        & +q  & +q & -q & -q  \\ 
 II       & +q  & -q & +q & -q  \\ 
 III      & +q  & -q & +q & +q  \\ 
 IV       & +q  & +q & +q & +q  \\ 
 V        & -q  & -q & -q & -q  \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{question}

\clearpage
\begin{solution}
The table is too confusing, so let's graph out $Q_1$, $Q_2$, $Q_3$, and $Q_4$ on a square:

\begin{center}
% \begin{tikzpicture}
% \draw (0,0) -- (0,2) -- (2,2) -- (2,0) -- (0,0);
% \node[above right] at (0,0) {$Q_4$};
% \node[below right] at (0,2) {$Q_1$};
% \node[below left] at (2,2) {$Q_2$};
% \node[above left] at (2,0) {$Q_3$};
% \end{tikzpicture}
\includegraphics{Figures/Figure29}
\end{center}

In order for the center of the square to have a zero electric field, the electric field must be zero when the point charges are superimposed. We can superimpose the charges diagonally. This is possible if and only if $Q_1 = Q_3$ and $Q_2 = Q_4$ only II,IV,V satisfy this criteria.

\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{question}
Which of the charge distributions introduced in the previous question is the potential zero at the origin?
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
The potential is zero at the origin if and only if the superposition of potential is equal to zero. Since potential is a scaler and all the charges are equidistant from the origin, this means that the total net charge at the origin has to be zero. In other words, the potential is zero, if and only if:

\begin{equation*}
    Q_1+Q_2+Q_3+Q_4=0
\end{equation*}

Only I, and II satisfy this criteria.

\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{question}
Two positive charges +Q are located on the -axis at (0,a) and (0,-a), and a third charge -q is on the positive x-axis at (x,0). Find the electric field along the x-axis as a function of position E(x), due to the positive charges.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
First, calculate the magnitude of the electric field as a function of position. Use the electric field equation (directly derived from Coulomb's Law) to figure out the electric field from one charge:

\begin{equation*}
    |E(x)| = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0\sqrt{(x^2+a^2)}^2} =
             \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+a^2)}
\end{equation*}

Now, to separate the magnitude of the electric field along the x-axis, using standard trigonometry techniques:

\begin{equation*}
    E(x)_x = |E(x)|cos(\theta) = |E(x)|(\frac{x}{\sqrt{(x^2+a^2)}})
    =
    \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+a^2)}(\frac{x}{\sqrt{(x^2+a^2)}})
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    E(x)_x =
    \frac{Qx}{4\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}
\end{equation*}

However, since we have two equally charged particles on the y-axis, we can superimpose them to get the final answer.\footnote{Because of symmetry, we can just multiply by two, instead of doing everything all over again}

\begin{equation*}
    E(x)_x =
    \frac{2Qx}{4\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}} =
    \frac{Qx}{2\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}
\end{equation*}

\end{solution}

\begin{question}
Two point charges +Q are located on the x-axis at (-d,0) and (d,0). Sketch the electric field $E(x)$ along the x-axis as a function of position.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
First, graph the individual electric fields each charge produces, then sum it up. Please note we are NOT graphing $\frac{Q}{r\pi\epsilon_0x^2}$. That gives the magnitude of the electric field. Since electric field is a vector, anything that is to the left (negative x direction) of the charge will have a negative electric field.

The individual electric fields will look like:\footnote{Because of program graphing issues, the vertical asymptotes are shown, but in reality both ends should extend to $\pm \infty$ meaning these vertical lines are not \emph{real}}

\begin{center}
% \begin{tikzpicture}
% \begin{axis}[
%     axis lines=middle,
%     xmin=-10, xmax=10,
%     ymin=-10, ymax=10,

%     ylabel = $E$,

% %Below the red is defined

% {1/(x+3)};
% \addlegendentry{$E(x)_{Q2}$}

% \end{axis}
% \end{tikzpicture}
\includegraphics{Figures/Figure210}
\end{center}

And after they are superimposed, and added, it will look like:

\begin{center}
% \begin{tikzpicture}
% \begin{axis}[
%     axis lines=middle,
%     xmin=-10, xmax=10,

\subsection*{Calculus}

\begin{question}
A charge of -Q is located at the origin, and two charges of +Q are located along the y-axis at (0,-a) and (0,a).

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Calculate the electric field along the x-axis, E(x)
    \item Calculate the approximate form of E(x) for very small x.
    \item Calculate the approximate form of E(x) for very large x.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}

(A) Along the +x axis, symmetry dicates that the field must point in the x-direction. Summing the contributions of the x-components of the electric fields due to the three point charges yields the following (The vector geometry is the same as one of the previous questions. If you haven't done them, do them now!)

\begin{equation*}
    E_{net} = E_{-Q} + 2E_{+Q} \rightarrow
    E_{net} = \frac{-Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2}
              +2[\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+a^2)}
                 \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+a^2}}]
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    E_{net} = \frac{-Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2} +
              \frac{Qx}{4\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}
\end{equation*}

(B) To approximate for very small x, we will make the following approximation:

\begin{equation*}
    x^2+a^2\approx a^2
\end{equation*}

Therefore:

\begin{equation*}
    E_{net} = \frac{-Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2} +
              \frac{Qx}{4\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}
            \approx
            \frac{-Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2} +
              \frac{Qx}{4\pi\epsilon_0 a^3}
\end{equation*}

But since:

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{1}{x^2} \gg x
\end{equation*}

Then:

\begin{equation*}
    E_{net} \approx 
                \frac{-Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2} +
                \frac{Qx}{4\pi\epsilon_0 a^3}
            \approx
                \frac{-Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2}
\end{equation*}

(C) To approximate for very large x, we can make a similar approximation:

\begin{equation*}
    x^2+a^2 \approx x^2
\end{equation*}

Therefore:

\begin{equation*}
    E_{net} = \frac{-Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2} +
              \frac{Qx}{4\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}
            \approx
              \frac{-Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2} +
              \frac{Qx}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^3}
            =
              \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2}
\end{equation*}

If you're not illiterate, you would have realized this is just the standard electric field equation! This is because when you are \emph{very} far away from the origin, it's impossible to see the separation of the three charges, it seems that they're all at the origin. The resulting field is due to the sum of the three charges: $Q_{effective}=Q+Q-Q=Q$, at the origin

\end{solution}

Recall that the electric field is the negative slope of the potential curve: $E_x=-\frac{dV}{dx}$ so the place where the force when the slope of the potential curve has a negative value with the greatest magnitude, which is at x=-1.
